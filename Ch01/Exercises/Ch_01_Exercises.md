1.  Think about the terms 'GIS', 'GDS' and 'geocomputation' described above. Which (if any) best describes the work you would like to do using geo\* methods and software and why?
    -   I'm not quite sure that any of them fully captures the synthesis of geospatial analysis and humanist/critical analysis I want to do; geocomputation, with its expansiveness, works best for the computational/systems component I am interested in, but overall, Critical GIS or Geographic Information Studies, looking at the way discourses shape GIS and its utilities in relation to social needs or contexts, might be more apt.
2.  Provide three reasons for using a scriptable language such as R for geocomputation instead of using a graphical user interface based GIS such as QGIS.
    i.  It can remove the cognitive clutter of menus-within-menus
    ii. (With the caveat that they are primarily aimed at python) GUI GIS programs are increasingly including greater interoperability of scripts and visual model builders, such that someone can have their cake and eat it too.
    iii. With the exception of proprietary API calls, much of the scripting languages used for spatial analyses are utilizing open source frameworks which greatly increases the predictability and accessibility of the materials.  
3.  Think about a real world problem you would like to solve with geographic data that could help people living in your local area and sketch a map of the geographic processes involved

4.  Consider the datasets needed to represent the problem computationally and sketch a workflow for processing them, resulting in outputs that could help inform decision making related to the problem you thought of in the previous exercise. Use a pen and paper or a digital sketching tool such as Excalidraw.
